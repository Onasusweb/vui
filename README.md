### Vui Admin
Unlike most themes that only provide a static UI, Vui Admin is a quick start application that provides a functional layout with many working features and a richer set of Vui componets designed especially for Admin projects. Just drop the package into your Laravel "resources/assests/js" folder and replace the default Welcome.blade.php file and your ready to start developing. 

### Vui Studio
Design and prototype your project interfaces using this drag and drop editor. Once you have a design, you can then generate
template code to add to your Vue project. Similar to Bootstrap Studio.

## Patreons
In order for me to dedicate time to design and develop these projects, I need to be able to support myself and pay the bills, so if you like the work I am doing and want to see more great projects added to the Vui Kit show your support and
become a pateron. You will get your logo or photo on this README page and also on every page of the Offical Vui-Kit website with a link to your site. [<a href="https://www.patreon.com/joe_lomoglio">Become a patron.</a>]
